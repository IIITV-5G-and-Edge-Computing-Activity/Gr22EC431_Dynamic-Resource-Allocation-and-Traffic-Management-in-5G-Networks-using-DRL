 With the explosive growth of mobile data demand, 5G
 networks need to support diverse applications like enhanced
 mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency com
munications (URLLC), and massive machine-type commu
nications (mMTC). Efficient management of these networks
 requires adaptive, intelligent solutions. Traditional methods,
 relying on static, rule-based techniques, are no longer sufficient
 to handle the dynamic, heterogeneous environments of 5G.
 Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) emerges as a promising
 solution, offering the ability to continuously adapt and opti
mize resource allocation and traffic management. This report
 dives into the specific challenges of resource management
 in 5G, such as network slicing, dynamic resource allocation,
 and the complexities of traffic management, and explores how
 DRL algorithms can address these
